## A brief introduction to NFT

**N**on-**F**ungible **T**okens are like cryptocurrencies, they are cryptographic tokens registered on a specific blockchain. However, they’re each entirely unique (and therefore, not mutually interchangeable) — like serialized collectibles of the digital world. <br>
There are multiple types of NFTs out there. Digital art can be registered on a blockchain, for example, as a way to certify authenticity and ownership. The result would be digital art NFTs that represent ownership of original, authentic artworks.

Or..

## What I bought ?

A ***.crypto domain name***. <br>
YES! Thanks to [Unstoppable Domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/) we can now purchase a domain name that is a smart contract on a public blockchian, in my case the domain I own is an ERC 721 on the Ethereum blockchain. 

These domains (or NFT) are stored on it's owner's wallet and nobody can take them away. 
Thing that may happen if you own a traditional domain, it can be censured or taken down.

Another feature that convinced me to buy one, is that there are not renewal fees ever!

I was able to bought it at 40$. When I'm writing this post I did not Claim it yet. Because the gas fees are too high so it's not worth it, I'm waiting that Unstoppable Domains enable Polygon network so the Minting and Gass fees will be almost zero.
 
This will happen on 15th of November.

## Pretty cool, but WHY?

This NFT can be used as:

- Universal username across apps and websites
- Website URL
- Payment address for wallets (Multiple wallets)

My favourite use is the last one, a easy-to-say wallet address is pretty usefull expecially if it can accept multiple currencies. 


I'll update this post when I'll do the Claiming.

I went back to Unstoppable domains and, finally, I was able to mint my NFT, I mint my domain. Now it's in my wallet aka it's mine.

But Im sad to see that I have to wait untill 12/12 to manage it.

The dashboard displays 5 option:

1. **`Crypto`**: here I can set a wallet for, litterally any coin!
2. **`Website`**: you can link you traditional website, (I linked this blog!), or you can build, as they call it, a decentrilized website (dweb) via some template they offer.
3. **`Verify`**: This feature is enabled only for domains minted on Ethereum :(
4. **`Profile`**: Here you can setup your profile with your name, surname, profile picture, socials and emails (public and private).
5. **`Picture`** [BETA]: If you own an NFT, you can upload it to be displayed as your domain's image

## Conclusions

At this point, I can easly say that an NFT domain is a nice to have, it's a powerful tool thanks to  its rialiability. Maybe in the future it will have more functionality so its better if you grab yours now ;).
