    <p>I'm P0WEX, here you can find, some post that I made about tech, cryptocurrency, software and also my hobbie such as elettronics and mechanical keyboard. I started writing this articles in the first place, because I want to track all my <b>thoughts / experiences / projects </b> in one place and maybe see of they change with the years.
